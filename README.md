# PyCAMIA

**Python Computer Aided Medical Image Analysis (PyCAMIA)** is a powerful toolkit collection for medical image analysis in python. The project is created by members of ZMIC laboratory, School of Data Science, Fudan University. `PyCAMIA` includes the following packages, please click the links to see more information. 

> The project is still under development, the available packages are marked with `*`. 

All following packages can be **installed** by command `pip install *`. 

- [`pycamia*`](./pycamia/README.md) [@contributor: All contributors]: A foundamental package for the project. It is included in most of the packages in the project and contains some basic self-designed functions and types. 
- [`pyoverload*`](./pyoverload/README.md) [@contributor: Yuncheng Zhou]: Overload package for python. It is consistant with `Jedi` auto-completion and only a simple `@overload` decorator is needed. 
- [`torchbatch`](./torchbatch/README.md) [@contributor: N/A]: An easy to use extension of `pytorch` with tensors with a batch specifier, variables with auto device selection, modules with simple read & write API and optimizers with trivial learning rate modifier. 
- [`micomputing`](./micomputing/README.md) [@contributor: N/A]: A package designed for medical image computing which focus on image registration and interpolation. 
- [`mivisual`](./mivisual/README.md) [@contributor: N/A]: A package that provides visualization for medical images, plots, charts, progress bars, numpy data, profiles etc.
